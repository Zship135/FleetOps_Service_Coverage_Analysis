# Geospatial Network Optimization: Identifying Strategic Warehouse Locations to Reduce Delivery Costs

## Background

FleetOps is a prominent Midwest delivery company, operating a network of 12 strategically located warehouses across Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota, Iowa, and Michigan.

Recently, the Operations and Logistics department has identified increasing strain on existing warehouse resources, leading to suboptimal efficiency and inflated delivery costs in specific regions. This strain is particularly evident in areas requiring long-distance deliveries from current hubs, resulting in higher fuel consumption, increased driver hours, and extended delivery times.

To address these challenges and enhance overall network efficiency and utilization, this project leverages geospatial data analysis. The objective is to identify optimal potential new warehouse locations that can alleviate pressure on struggling areas, effectively reducing operational costs, improving service levels, and strengthening FleetOps' competitive advantage in key underserved markets.
